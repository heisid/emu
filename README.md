# EMU CHIP8

Another pathetic attempt to create an emulator. This time it's a humble CHIP-8.
With language I know jackshit about: Java.

## Test ROMs
- https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite

## Known Problems
- Keypad input hasn't worked properly yet for most ROMs, but okay for ROM "Keypad Test [Hap, 2006].ch8"

## Todos:
- ~~Fixed framerate~~
- Load ROM graphical interface
- Emulator state display (registry, stack memory, etc)
