# EMU (Just Emu, because I'm lazy af to come up with better name)

Another pathetic attempt to create an emulator. This time it's a humble CHIP-8.
With language I know jackshit about: Java. (Btw, I know Javanese and Javascript... I don't know why
I mention this, but... just saying). I'm such a noob, I even googled how to declare an array in Java.
Maybe Python is easier and I'm more familiar with. Or Rust will be faster, but who cares. I do whatever I want.


I don't even know where I can get CHIP-8 ROM to test this project.
